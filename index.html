      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        I’m a Data Engineer currently at Workday with over 4 years of experience working on data pipelines, 
        ETL processes, and analytics solutions. My passion is helping businesses make data-driven decisions 
        by ensuring their data is accessible, reliable, and insightful. 
      </p>
      <p>
        As a lifelong learner, I regularly dive into new tools and technologies to stay on top of 
        the evolving data landscape. My hands-on expertise includes building scalable data architectures, 
        optimizing SQL queries, automating workflows, and constructing data dashboards that deliver 
        actionable insights.

      <h2>About Shopify</h2>
      <p>
        Opportunity is not evenly distributed. Shopify puts independence within reach for anyone 
        with a dream to start a business. We propel entrepreneurs and enterprises to scale the heights 
        of their potential. Since 2006, we’ve grown to over 8,300 employees and generated over $1 trillion 
        in sales for millions of merchants in 175 countries.
      </p>
      <p>
        This is life-defining work that directly impacts people’s lives as much as it transforms your own. 
        This is putting the power of the few in the hands of the many, is a future with more voices rather 
        than fewer, and is creating more choices instead of an elite option.
      </p>
      <h3>About You (Shopifolk)</h3>

        Moving at our pace brings a lot of change, complexity, and ambiguity—and a little bit of chaos.
